### How Replacing 9th Grade Scores Affected the Following Tables:

* **Math and Reading Scores by Grade**
  * Because the scores replaced were in one grade for one school, this did not affect the overall output of this table other than Thomas High Schools output before the edit.  The scores prior to the edit were 83.6% for math and 83.7% for reading in the 9th grade.  
* **Scores by School Spending**
  * *The average scores post edit of Thomas High school remained the same.  However, the passing percentages were lower in the $630 - $644 range.*
  * % Passing Math decreased from 83% to 73%
  * % Passing reading decreased from 94% to 84%
  * % Passing Overall decreased from 72% to 63%
* **Scores by School Size**
